# ToDo

1. Home Screen
- is it worth changing the format so I have two separate views, one for on call and a summary page? It could re-route to the summary page if on call.
  This could be done by separate URLS: /summary and /oncall
- Need to tidy up the get_context_data function. 
- Add "new call" section to modal window --> need to learn how to do this with class views

2. Roster:
- No idea how to do this yet
- Would need signals with OnCall to add/modify sessions so management is done by this part

3. Search function:
- search descriptions
- stratify by type of call?
- Add an area for uploading & management of documents
