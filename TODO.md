# ToDo

The plan is to have this entirely in django except for the roster and app itself

## Home Screen
- Add automatic tests!

### Issues with OnCall/Calls:
- Times can overlap
- Can't complete a call until finish time known
- Logic with call-in time and no-9hr break non existent 

## Roster:
- No idea how to do this yet
- Would need signals with OnCall to add/modify sessions so management is done by this part

## Search function:
- search descriptions
- stratify by type of call?
- Add an area for uploading & management of documents
